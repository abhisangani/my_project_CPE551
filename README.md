# Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection System

## Introduction

This project is my individual EE551 Python project for Spring 2019 term

## Proposal

This system will help in detecting fraud/fake credit card transactions using Naive Bayes classifier.

## Features

- The system will analyze a data which will consist of hundreds of thousands of credit card transactions.
- Based on the analysis, the system will be able to detect fraud/fake transactions.

## To-Do

- Import the data using pandas.
- Convert all the input features into some other features using PCA.
- Plot graph of fraud transactions and genuine transactions.
- Train the classifier to detect fraud points from the graphs.
